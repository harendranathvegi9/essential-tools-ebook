<h2>Pocket</h2>
<p><strong>Bookmarking &amp; reading</strong></p>
<p><br />
We save interesting articles and read them later in Pocket.</p>
<p>If you come across a good article, but don’t have the time to read at the moment (or it’s just too long and you don’t have the willpower), save it in Pocket for later.</p>
<p>Just press the browser extension button to save the article on your phone. You can then read it offline during a commute or while waiting for an appointment. When you finish, mark it as read, and move on to the next article.</p>
<p>This way you never run out of things to read, use your down-time efficiently, and save office-time for work. Plus, articles are much easier and quicker to read once there are no banners, navigation, or other superfluous information hijacking your attention and peripheral vision.</p>

<h2>RescueTime</h2>
<p><strong>Time analysis and management</strong></p>
<p><br />
RescueTime saves us from wasting time and productivity on mindless web surfing.</p>
<p>You know how sometimes you click on a link, and two hours later you’re somewhere else entirely — and you haven’t done a single productive thing? That’s why we use RescueTime.</p>
<p>It’s an app that tracks how much time you spend on every website, checks if it’s work related, and ranks how productive you were today (and how you compare to yesterday).</p>
<p>It’s a great app for policing yourself and seeing where your time goes so you can fix it. It answers both:</p>
<ul>
<li>What have I’ve been doing the whole day?</li>
<li>Where does the time go?</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you install it, you’ll think twice before giving into the temptation to read a clickbait article you know is irrelevant.</p>
<p><br />
<br />

<p><strong>Analyze where the times goes</strong><br />
The dashboard lets you see where you spend your days and what your biggest time wasters are, categorized by time and day.</p>

<h2>Google Keep</h2>
<p><strong>Personal notes</strong></p>
<p><br />
To save notes quickly, we use Keep.</p>
<p>It’s a Google product, works offline, and is very simple to use. If we write a note in the mobile app, we can later open it from our work computer’s browser.</p>
<p>This way, we can access the same notes from different platforms, without the need to manage them. It’s also useful for saving interesting passages from a Pocket article.</p>
<p>You can color code notes to make them easy to distinguish, add reminders and labels, create simple lists, attach images, and draw notes.</p>

<h2>Grammarly</h2>
<p><strong>Spell checking</strong></p>
<p><br />
To fix spelling and grammatical errors in one click, we use Grammarly.</p>
<p>Grammarly is an extension that spots errors anywhere you type in the browser and suggests solutions.</p>
<p>What makes it better than the built-in spell checker is:</p>
<ul>
<li>ease of correction where you just hover over a word and fix the error with one click</li>
<li>grammar check, eg. if the singular subject agrees with the correct verb form</li>
<li>style check makes sure you use the correct punctuation</li>
</ul>
<p>There’s also a web app that’s good for longer texts —just  copy/paste the text (like a blog article) into the app, and it suggests both spelling and grammar corrections.</p>

<h2>8tracks</h2>
<p><strong>Music playlists</strong></p>
<p><br />
We rely on 8track and YouTube playlists for the music in the office.</p>
<p>Music is good for improving productivity and creativity. Repetitive, non-vocal electronic music helps us stay in the flow while coding or doing other deep work; on the other hand, pop and rock are good for energy and working on repetitive tasks that require no mental input..</p>
<p>YouTube is great for finding music when we know what we want to listen to (album mixes, best-of playlists, or long summer mixes).</p>
<p>In contrast, 8tracks is perfect when we don’t know what to play next and don’t have inspiration. It lets us listen to a fresh compilation of stuff we never heard before, gathered around a vibe — like Bossa Nova, roaring 1920s, tropical chill house, acoustic rock, game music, oldies, etc.</p>
<p>We start a playlist on 8tracks and we have a nice atmosphere in the office the entire day, without having to think about what to play next.</p>
<p><br />

<p><strong>Music for the whole day</strong><br />
Music improves our mood, makes us happier - and more productive. It also covers background noises and gives the whole office a stable rhythm.</p>
