<h2>MailChimp</h2>
<p><strong>Email marketing</strong></p>
<p><br />
For sending newsletters, we use MailChimp.</p>
<p>Every month, we send all our users a short newsletter with the most important updates (like new feature).</p>
<p>Writing a newsletter used to be painstaking: you wrote your whole layout using HTML tables and inline styles, and hoped nothing breaks in different email clients.</p>
<p>MailChimp simplifies all this. The interface is great, newsletters are easy to make and look beautiful in every mail client, and we don’t have to worry about ending up in spam or being blacklisted.</p>
<p>MailChimp tracks how many people opened our newsletter and clicked on the call to action button. We did an A/B test before sending a huge newsletter to find out what type of subject, headline, and layout have the highest conversion rate. This helped us craft the perfect final email announcing the new version of Active Collab.</p>
<p><br />
<br />

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Creating a newsletter is easy</strong><br />
We just drag-and-drop different boxes and insert the images and text. Before sending, we can check if everything is ok with a test email.</p>

<h2>Buffer</h2>
<p><strong>Social media scheduler</strong></p>
<p><br />
To share updates and interesting content on our social profiles, we use Buffer.</p>
<p>It offers one centralized hub for managing multiple social accounts. So instead of giving password to someone to all the accounts, we create them a Buffer account so they can post and analyze the engagement of their posts.</p>
<p>We come across a lot of things on the internet that we’d love to share: sometimes an interesting article on productivity or design, a tweet brimming with wit and insight, or a funny drawing that brightens our day.</p>
<p>When we’re on a web page, we can share it with a click of a button thanks to Buffer’s browser extension.</p>
<p>Buffer lets us schedule when we want to share things. Instead of sharing a bunch things immediately and spam our followers, we can put 20 tweets or Facebook posts and let Buffer spread them out through the week, and post at times we tell it to.</p>
<p>It also has the Analytics dashboard which shows how many people clicked, liked and shared, and how many people the post reached.</p>
<p><br />
<br />
<img src="media/file49.png" alt="Something relevant each day" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Something relevant each day</strong><br />
We post Active Collab updates, though-provoking articles on design and business, humorous images, workflow tips - anything worth sharing that’ll make people more productive and better at their jobs.</p>

<h2>Google Analytics</h2>
<p><strong>Website analytics</strong></p>
<p><br />
For tracking metrics and gauging how efficient our marketing is, we use Google Analytics.</p>
<p>In order to make things people will use, we need to know:</p>
<ul>
<li>How many visitors we have</li>
<li>How many of them leave within 2 seconds</li>
<li>Where they come from</li>
<li>How much they spend on each page</li>
<li>Which blog and help articles they read</li>
</ul>
<p>We use all this information to know what works and what doesn’t so we can focus our time and energy on things that bring results.</p>
<p>We track the success of our marketing campaigns with UTM codes so we can see where referrals come from. If one source of traffic proves great for a particular audience, we pursue it for maximum efficiency,</p>
<p>We integrated Analytics with FastSpring so we can see how much revenue each campaign brings — a crucial metric to have before spending any money on advertising.</p>
<p><br />
<br />
<img src="media/file50.png" alt="We know what to write about" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>We know what to write about</strong><br />
We select and feature the most popular articles on our blog based on the statistics from Google Analytics. We measure which articles get read so we can focus our writing on similar stuff. This way we don’t waste time on things no one cares about.</p>

<h2>Optimizely</h2>
<p><strong>A/B testing</strong></p>
<p><br />
For A/B testing our website, we use Optimizely.</p>
<p>It lets us create two versions of a home page (or a landing page), change some elements, and see which version gets more clicks and better conversion - i.e. how many people sign up for Active Collab based solely on how the page is designed.</p>
<p>With Optimizely, we’ve tried a few different headlines, like “Stay organized when you outgrow email” and “Powerful, yet simple project management” to see which copy gets more signups.</p>
<p>This is perfect when we have a few ideas about the best design and copy, but can’t decide which to use. So we test it to make sure we have a backing argument behind each design decision.</p>
<p>Test results are displayed as a nice chart, as well as a detailed spreadsheet. A/B testing your assumptions is great both for learning what works as well as discovering why something didn’t perform well.</p>
<p>Optimizely tells us which version converts better and gives us hard numbers, but it can’t answer why one version outperforms the other. That’s why you have to create a test environment that’s controlled enough to let you isolate the cause. Sticking to one change per test (eg. using long vs short headlines) is usually the best practice.</p>
<p><br />
<br />
<img src="media/file51.png" alt="The purpose of design is to sell" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The purpose of design is to sell</strong><br />
We test a landing page to see whether to include a footer, pricing, both, or neither. Then we track how each variation fares in the real world. Once a statistical significance is established, we stop the test and use the variation that has the highest sign-up rate.</p>

<h2>UsabilityHub</h2>
<p><strong>User testing</strong></p>
<p><br />
For qualitative feedback of our A/B tests, we use UsabilityHub.</p>
<p>You know when you’re designing something, one person prefers one design and you the other? With UsabilityHub you can flat-out ask anonymous people what they think.</p>
<p>You can ask testers:</p>
<ul>
<li>which design they prefer</li>
<li>what a page is about by looking at it for 5 seconds</li>
<li>where they would click in order to achieve something</li>
<li>can they navigate through your design</li>
<li>or just show the design and ask what they think</li>
</ul>
<p>When we did a redesign of our homepage, we showed people different designs and asked which one they prefer and what they think Active Collab is by looking at the homepage for 5 seconds.</p>
<p>If more than 20% couldn’t answer that it’s a project management tool that helps teams stay organized, we had to rewrite the page.</p>
<p><br />
<br />
<img src="media/file52.png" alt="Make sure your visitors understand you" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Make sure your visitors understand you</strong><br />
We showed a proposed redesign and asked people three questions: What’s the page for? What’s confusing or needs more explanation? Would you try the product and why yes/no?</p>

<h2>UserTesting</h2>
<p><strong>User testing</strong></p>
<p><br />
We use User Testing to see how new users interact with Active Collab for the first time.</p>
<p>It lets us see Active Collab from the perspective of a user who never used it before (i.e. a new potential customers we wish to win over).</p>
<p>If they can’t find their way around Active Collab and don’t see the benefit in using it, that’s a huge fail on our side.</p>
<p>For example, we thought the flow for inviting people was great. But looking at a recording of how a real person tries to invite someone — and gets stuck — was an eye-opening experience that challenged our core assumptions.</p>
<p>We wrote the instructions and tasks for the tester, which they read and tried to accomplish in Active Collab, all while recording their screen and sharing their thoughts. In the end, they answered a few questions about their experience.</p>
<p>Thanks to these tests, we redesigned some sections and are actively working on improving user onboarding so new users have the best experience possible and continue to use our app.</p>
<p><br />

<p><strong>Our app from a different perspective</strong><br />
All we tell the tester is to organize an office party using Active Collab. How they do it is up to them. The goal is to see if testers stumble when they have to create tasks, invite people, etc.</p>

<h2>Hotjar</h2>
<p><strong>Heat maps</strong></p>
<p><br />
Hotjar lets us see where people click on our website.</p>
<p>The heat map shows where visitors click the most and how many of them scroll all the way to the bottom of the page; we use this information to see what they’re most interested in.</p>
<p>For some pages (like help articles), it doesn’t matter that much. But for the homepage and landing pages, it’s important to know how many people scrolled all the way to the signup form.</p>
<p>If people don’t scroll down, it means the top of the page didn’t interest them enough. That’s usually a signal that we need to improve the page by creating a new version and and A/B test it against the original.</p>
<p>Or if people click on a static picture or icon, it means they want to see a bigger image or expect some kind of interaction.</p>
<p>This way we know what’s engaging, what doesn’t work, and how to come up with a better layout that’ll drive engagement and conversion.</p>

<div id="typeform" class="section level2">
<h2>Typeform</h2>
<p><strong>Survey forms</strong></p>
<p><br />
For quick surveys and research, we use Typeform.</p>
<p>When we’re developing a new feature, we ask our existing users for input. We want to learn how they work and what their needs are in order to design a feature they’ll actually use.</p>
<p>For example, we want to add chat functionality to Active Collab, which is a big project. We weren’t sure how to best implement it - as a standalone desktop app or as a chat widget in the web interface.</p>
<p>We made a questionnaire in Typeform asking users about their requirements, workflow, and if they’d rather chat inside Active Collab or have a dedicated app. We showed them the two designs and asked which one they preferred and why.</p>
<p>We sent the link to the Typeform survey through MailChimp and got surprising results: one third didn’t want the chat at all, and the other two thirds were split 50-50 between in-app and desktop app. Even with results like these, it still helped: we knew two thirds didn’t want chat inside Active Collab, which saved us from pursuing a design that wouldn’t be used.</p>
<p>What sets Typeform apart is the intuitive way users fill out the survey: they’re gently guided through the questions one-by-one, instead of getting a huge list at once - this way, people will more likely fill out the form and give us the info we need.</p>
<p><br />

<h2>Google Forms</h2>
<p><strong>Survey forms</strong></p>
<p><br />
For gathering customer feedback, we use Google Forms.</p>
<p>It’s more robust than Typeform and works better with complex data. It syncs with Google Spreadsheets so we can get new responses inside our spreadsheet as they come (and later analyze them).</p>
<p>When we receive customer feedback by email, we either ask the customer to fill out our feedback form, or we fill it out for them. We also ask our trial users if there are any deal breaker features they’re missing.</p>
<p>This way we can see what the most requested features are and where we should focus our development. Filtering the results by number of occurrence lets us see the number of requests per feature for a given time period. This helps us decide what to work on next and update our feature roadmap.</p>
<p><br />
<br />
<img src="media/file58.png" alt="Everything we need to know about feature requests" /></p>

<p><strong>Everything we need to know about feature requests</strong><br />

<p>We use SocialBro to grow our follower list and Buffer to share useful information with them. There’s no point in having a social media profile just for the sake of it. In order to keep followers we need to share good content.</p>

<h2>Google AdWords</h2>
<p><strong>Online advertising</strong></p>
<p><br />
For bringing traffic to our landing pages, we use AdWords.</p>
<p>First we researched who average buyers are, why they chose us, and what problem Active Collab solves for them.</p>
<p>Then, we created several landing pages, each addressing a specific need for different customer segments, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>people who are looking for a secure project management they can host themselves</li>
<li>design and marketing agencies that work with clients and a lot of projects</li>
<li>startups who need to organize different departments</li>
<li>freelancers who need one tool to manage their work and bill based on tracked time</li>
</ul>
<p>Then we pay to show these pages as Google search whenever someone searches for the related keywords we bought. That way, we make sure people who need our software actually find it.</p>
<p>After the campaigns have been running for a while, we analyze our ROI per keyword. If a landing page doesn’t pay itself at least two times over, we stop it and focus on the ones that do better.</p>
<p><br />
<br />
<img src="media/file61.png" alt="Targeting different countries" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Targeting different countries</strong><br />
Most our users are from the USA and Europe. AdWords lets us display different pages, depending on where the user is from. We can see how much each click costs and how many people clicked. We then track the conversion on our website with Google Analytics.</p>

<h2>Medium</h2>
<p><strong>Blogging</strong></p>
<p><br />
We publish some articles from our blog on Medium too.</p>
<p>Medium is a great distribution channel for longer articles like blog posts. We used to have the whole company blog there but later moved it back to our website, a business decision we made for pragmatic reasons (domain authority, remarketing, conversion, SEO, etc.).</p>
<p>On our blog, we share how we work and what we’ve learned — things that could help others so they share it. Some people will find it on our website and others on Medium. What matters is that people read and recommend to others.</p>
<p>Medium doesn’t give us much control over customizing how posts look; but at least every post looks great by default.</p>
<p>Medium is at its core a social network so we treat it as such. Instead of publishing all the articles there, we publish what gets people’s attention and take advantage of Medium’s recommendation mechanism and reach.</p>
