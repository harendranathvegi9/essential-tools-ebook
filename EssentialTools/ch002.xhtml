<h2>Active Collab</h2>
<p><strong>Project management</strong></p>
<p><br />
To keep up with our to-dos and work-related tasks that involve more than two people, we use Active Collab.</p>
<p>Active Collab is our main information hub, while other tools act as support. We keep a separate project for everything:</p>
<ul>
<li>All the reported bugs and feature requests</li>
<li>Work in progress</li>
<li>One for each product (Timer, Android, iOS, SupportYard)</li>
<li>One for each team or process (support, marketing, management, HR)</li>
<li>Other things (UX, blog, analytics)</li>
</ul>
<p>By looking at the My Work page, everyone knows what to do next. It keeps track of our assignments and notifications for tasks we’re subscribed to.</p>
<p>To get an update on everything that happened the day before, we scan the global Activity page. It lists every new comment, task, status update, and more.</p>
<p>Notes are good for saving important information that’s accessed semi-regularly (release notes, workflow guidelines, and feature suggestions).</p>
<p>Active Collab also has time tracking and invoicing features, but we don’t use them because we don’t do client work or charge by the hour.</p>
<p><br />

<p><strong>A separate project for work in progress</strong><br />
Splitting tasks in two project helps us focus on the work at hand, separating what we’d like to work on from what really needs to be done.</p>

<h2>Slack</h2>
<p><strong>Chat</strong></p>
<p><br />
Slack lets us quickly and informally message each other.</p>
<p>That way we don’t have to overburden Active Collab with disposable information that has a short lifespan.</p>
<p>We chat in channels divided by interests like #support, #management, #dev, #builds, #feather, and #marketing.</p>
<p>We also have a #chitchat and #general channel for banter, birthdays, funny links, and questions (like where to buy good barbecue or how to extend a personal ID card).</p>
<p>Direct messages are good for quickly sharing a file or a piece of text - we just drag and drop a file and the person gets a notification so they can download it.</p>
<p>Channels, on the other hand, are good for sharing updates and getting instant answers to burning questions (like which account needs technical assistance or what’s the ETA for some feature).</p>
<p>We use the Slack desktop app so we can hit cmd+tab to open it quickly and see a notification. But if we’re away from our work computer, we can always access Slack through a browser or a mobile app.</p>

<h2>Dropbox</h2>
<p><strong>File storage</strong></p>
<p><br />
Dropbox is great for working together on the same files and accessing them regardless what computer we’re on.</p>
<p>We have a common Dropbox folder where we put all our designs so they’re accessible to everyone. This saves us from sending files back and forth whenever there’s an updated version.</p>
<p>Dropbox, when installed on a computer, creates a folder that behaves like any other folder: you can copy, delete, and edit files, and those actions will be applied across all other computers which have that folder.</p>
<p>We also use Dropbox for storage. If we need to share a file with someone who’s not authorized to access the folder, we can always right-click on the file, copy the weblink, and share it. This way, the recipient has access only to the file they asked for.</p>
<p><br />
<br />
<img src="media/file3.png" alt="Same files across computers" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Same files across computers</strong><br />
Everyone has access to the folder with the design files on their own computer. It’s automatically updated whenever there’s a new file version. This way, there’s no back-and-forth file sharing and wondering if you’re working on an outdated version.</p>

<h2>QuickTime</h2>
<p><strong>Video capture</strong></p>
<p><br />
We use QuickTime to record bugs and show developers what the problem looks like.</p>
<p>Sometimes bugs are difficult to describe, or it’s just much quicker to see the bug in action rather than read/write about it. Images don’t show cause-and-effect relationship and that often leaves video as the best solution.</p>
<p>We shoot the video of the screen and upload it to Active Collab as an attachment on the task related to the bug. The developer or QA can then quickly see how to reproduce the bug.</p>
<p>QuickTime is great for making disposable videos that don’t require further editing or polishing for marketing.</p>
<p>It’s also great for capturing both desktop footage as well as iPhone/iPad screens.</p>
<p><br />
<br />
<img src="media/file5.png" alt="Running QuickTime is easy" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Running QuickTime is easy</strong><br />
All you have to do is start a new screen recording and press Record. Then you can upload the file wherever you want.</p>

<img src="media/file6.png" alt="QuickTime .mov files are great attachments" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>QuickTime .mov files are great attachments</strong><br />
The file size is small so we can quickly attach and download them. The video quality is still excellent so we can see the interface text clearly.</p>

<div id="google-docs" class="section level2">
<h2>Google Docs</h2>
<p><strong>Collaborative writting</strong></p>
<p><br />
We use Google Docs for collaborative writing and proofreading (eg. blog posts, help articles, and this ebook).</p>
<p>It works like a usual word processor, only there aren’t any files on our computers - just links we share. This means there’s no sending files back-and-forth or wondering if you’re working on the latest version.</p>
<p>We create a new document and share the link in Active Collab or Slack. Then people can make hard and soft edits (soft ones need to be approved), or just highlight words and leave comments, like we do on book margins.</p>
<p>You can even see where someone’s cursor is or what word they highlighted (good to make sure your writing doesn’t overlap when multiple people are working on the same document).</p>
<p>We also use Google Docs for storing and sorting large amounts of information that need a clear hierarchy and visual cues for fast scanning. A good example is customer feedback: less relevant information is light gray, and important bits are black.</p>
<p>And the best thing about Google Docs is there’s no installation: it doesn’t matter what computer your coworker uses; as long as they have a browser, everything works.</p>
<p><br />
<br />
<img src="media/file7.png" alt="Perfect for proofreading" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Perfect for proofreading</strong><br />
People can make edits (which get approved or rejected), changes are easy to see, and we don’t have to install anything.</p>

<div id="google-sheets" class="section level2">
<h2>Google Sheets</h2>
<p><strong>Online spreadsheets</strong></p>
<p><br />
We use Google Sheets for tracking and analysing complex data.</p>
<p>Like Google Docs, you edit the spreadsheet in the browser and there’s a link to it so everyone has the latest version . The rest is almost like Excel, except it’s free, your coworkers don’t have to install anything, and it works on every computer.</p>
<p>Google Sheets is great for keeping complex information in one place. We keep all kinds of data in it: survey results, feature requests, a list of people who want to be notified when a certain feature is released, etc.</p>
<p>For example, we have a form our agents fill out when users leave feedback. Every piece of info is added to the spreadsheet with the user contact info and categorized by type. This helps us measure which features are most frequently requested and decide what to work on next..</p>
<p>So when we decided to improve how Active Collab works with files, we just filtered the spreadsheet for anything containing the word “file” and contacted our users for use cases. This way we develop features based on real-life feedback and deliver software that solves actual problems.</p>

<h2>DokuWiki</h2>
<p><strong>Knowledge Base</strong></p>
<p><br />
We use DokuWiki as our internal knowledge base.</p>
<p>It’s an open-source project we downloaded and installed on our server so only people on our company network can access it through a browser.</p>
<p>We keep all our FAQs and useful information  in it— like links to the tools and accounts we use, survey results, support guidelines, coding style guides, how-to instructions, etc.</p>
<p>DokuWiki holds only core, evergreen knowledge. Information is sorted and nested under different categories so finding the right information is quick and easy.</p>
<p>We use wiki when we need to refresh our memory on how to do something we don’t do every day (like migrating big cloud accounts). Or when a new developer joins the team, we can give them a link to our wiki article that explains how the backend works or how to set up a MySQL database that works with Ansible.</p>
<p>Writing wiki articles requires special wiki syntax, but that’s really easy to learn.</p>

<p><strong>Must-know essentials in one place</strong><br />
A lot of information is scattered across other apps, from Active Collab to various docs and chat rooms. But the really important things are always close at hand in our wiki.</p>
