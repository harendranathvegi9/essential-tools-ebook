<h2>Sketch</h2>
<p><strong>Prototyping</strong></p>
<p><br />
We design everything in Sketch.</p>
<p>It’s lightweight and lets us create elegant designs in a matter of minutes. We can create mockups quickly and see what works visually. Thanks to it, we can spend more working out UX solutions than manipulating vectors and pixels.</p>
<p>We never code without first designing the UX and UI in Sketch. We create web pages, new Active Collab features, mobile screens, icons, illustrations, and other assets in it.</p>
<p>Because Sketch works with vectors, we never have to worry about the image quality. Adding shadows and borders, choosing colors, aligning elements - it’s so quick and easy that we have more time to experiment and find the best solution.</p>
<p>The reason why it’s the best? It’s forgiving and encourages experimentation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Working out the UX for a mobile app</strong><br />
We design each screen and define relationships between them before we start coding. This makes coding safer and using the app more natural.</p>

<p><strong>Book design evolution</strong><br />
Before we start laying out the book in Scribus, we first decide how it’ll look like in Sketch.</p>

<h2>PhotoScape</h2>
<p><strong>Image editing</strong></p>
<p><br />
PhotoScape is excellent for quick photo editing.</p>
<p>It lets us quickly resize and crop images in a certain ratio, combine them, add special effects, apply filters, make collages, batch edit, and more. All effects are easy to apply so you can quickly see what looks the best.</p>
<p>On top of that, Quick Menu lets us fix everything in an image with just two clicks. GIMP and Sketch can do all those things but you have to go through several steps, which makes simple actions like resizing more complicated than it needs to be.</p>
<p>With PhotoScape, we can prepare an image for a tweet or a blog post in a few minutes. Even ordinary photos can look awesome once you add a gradient or a filter.</p>
<p><br />
<br />

<p><strong>Cool effects</strong><br />
PhotoScape lets us create eye catching images quickly. All it takes is a one good filter and a nice frame.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
<img src="media/file43.png" alt="Combine images" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Combine images</strong><br />
We can create one image from several others very fast. Perfect when you need two images side by side but don’t need the overhead Photoshop or GIMP bring.</p>

<div id="gimp" class="section level2">
<h2>GIMP</h2>
<p><strong>Image editing</strong></p>
<p><br />
For more complex image editing, we use GIMP.</p>
<p>Sketch has a very poor image editor, so before we import an image, we edit it in GIMP. There, we can select what shapes to exclude, delete the background, smooth out the surface, rearrange layers, and fix other minor mistakes.</p>
<p>It’s free and can do just as much as Photoshop. It takes a while to learn and it’s not the prettiest solution, but it gives us enough control when we need it.</p>
<p><br />
<br />
<img src="media/file44.png" alt="Cleaning up the photo" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Cleaning up the photo</strong><br />
We can pick and choose what elements we need in our photo and rearrange them. For example, we can select the pen and move it over the coffee, or delete the eraser if it doesn’t fit the composition.</p>

<h2>Scribus</h2>
<p><strong>Desktop publishing</strong></p>
<p><br />
We create ebooks in Scribus because it gives us more control when it comes to document layout.</p>
<p>Scribus is a desktop publishing app and acts as a great free replacement to InDesign and QuarkXPress. We use it to create complex and professional layouts.</p>
<p>First, we create master templates with elements that are repeated on each page. Then, we can put image and text frames on the page, and insert content later.</p>
<p>We mark up text as having a certain style (eg. main paragraph, chapter subheading) and then set the paragraph indentation, font type and size, line height, etc.</p>
<p>Then, if we decide to change the font size for a particular style, the changes are applied everywhere automatically. This way we’re free to experiment with different settings without having to update each paragraph manually.</p>
<p>Scribus is not very intuitive and takes time to learn how to use. Our best advice is to watch a few YouTube tutorials to get a better hang of it.</p>

<h2>Final Cut Pro X</h2>
<p><strong>Video editing</strong></p>
<p><br />
We create our video tutorials and testimonials in Final Cut Pro X.</p>
<p>It’s a video editing software that gives us great creative control and lets us make engaging videos.</p>
<p>Before making a video, we first write an outline and a script. Then we get the presenter and shot video segments using several takes.</p>
<p>Next comes editing in Final Cut Pro X: we decide which takes are the best and leave what doesn’t work on the cutting floor.</p>
<p>We then add custom animations, special effects, and music. The finished videos are uploaded to our Wistia account so we can embed them on our website.</p>
<p><br />
<br />

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Editing</strong><br />
Each video segment is on a timeline. We can drag them around, edit timing, and insert different takes to see what works best.</p>
