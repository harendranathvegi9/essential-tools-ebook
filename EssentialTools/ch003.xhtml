<h2>SupportYard</h2>
<p><strong>Help desk</strong></p>
<p><br />
Our main support tool that we use to reply to customer emails is SupportYard.</p>
<p>It helps us assign to our support agents all the email we get and then respond to quickly. It’s one of the reasons we get feedback like: “Thanks for replying so fast, I never met support team that fast, nor Basecamp or another web product. You really have quality stuff and staff :)”</p>
<p>Every email that’s sent to support@activecollab.com appears in SupportYard and is marked as “New”. When a support team member sees the new ticket, they take it so no email goes unanswered.</p>
<p>After they respond, the ticket is automatically marked as “Replied”; if there’s no more activity, we mark it as “Closed”. This way we can prioritize our work and see what needs our attention.</p>
<p>We receive all kinds of email: questions about downloading the Timer, bug reports, account management, payments, feedback, feature requests, installation assistance, login issues, business proposals, upgrade instructions, workflow suggestions - just to name a few.</p>
<p>The integration with Active Collab will soon let us connect tasks and tickets. So for example, when we receive a bug report, we can test it and turn it into a task in Active Collab. After our developers fix the bug, the ticket gets updated so our agents know they can notify the client.</p>

<h2>LiveChat</h2>
<p><strong>Customer chat</strong></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>We talk to our website visitors in real time using LiveChat.</p>
<p>Setup is very easy - you just copy/paste a piece of code on your website, install the desktop app for support agents, and you’re ready to chat with your customers. Visitors can then ask you anything right on the spot and get instant answers.</p>
<p>It’s like when some people walk into a store and prefer to browse on their own, while others ask the salesperson about the product. LiveChat is there for those who prefer interaction with a real person.</p>
<p>It also lets us be proactive - if they’re on the Pricing page, a pop-up appears after 30 seconds asking “Do you need help figuring out the price?”, or if they’re on the Features pages “Any particular feature you’re looking for?”.</p>
<p>We treat each chat as an opportunity to connect with our customers, familiarize them with Active Collab, and leave a good impression.</p>
<p>Chats are also a good source of web design improvements. After we design a landing page, we can see what kind of questions keep popping up. They tell us what’s missing and what we can explain better. The feedback we get helps us improve the landing page and the conversion rate..</p>

<h2>Skype + Zaplee</h2>
<p><strong>Free calls</strong></p>
<p><br />
For one-on-one calls, we use our Skype account that’s connected to a toll-free Zaplee number.</p>
<p>Customers can call us for free if they’re in the United States, and it costs us just 2.3¢ per minute.</p>
<p>We can also receive regular Skype calls, which is a good option for anyone outside of the US.</p>
<p>Having phone support assures customers they can talk to a real person - something that’s often absent in the world of software.. It’s also comforting in case there’s an urgent technical problem and they want to check up on the status of their ticket. So having a telephone number is important, even if it’s not used all that much.</p>

<p><strong>Booking</strong></p>
<p><br />
Our customers can a book a personalized webinar by using YouCanBook.me.</p>
<p>We hold webinars to help onboard our users and show them around Active Collab. To schedule a webinar, all they need to do is pick an available date on YouCanBook.me.</p>
<p>Then they fill out a form to tell us about their requirements so we can personalize the webinar. This way, webinars are engaging and relevant to their line of work.</p>
<p>The booking process is very easy. YouCanBook.me makes sure people don’t book the same time slot and also takes care of managing time zones - every user sees the available times in their own time. It also sends a reminder before the webinar to make sure neither party forgets.</p>

<h2>Join.me</h2>
<p><strong>Hoding webinars</strong></p>
<p><br />
For holding webinars and live demos, we use Join.me.</p>
<p>Once the customer booked a webinar and the date arrived, they gather their team and join us via the Join.me website.</p>
<p>The client doesn’t have to install anything - the chat and video streaming happen in the browser. However, we do need to install software on our side so we can share our desktop with the attendees.</p>
<p>Once everyone has joined, we can show Active Collab in action. We guide clients through the functionality, show tips and tricks, and let them ask questions.</p>
<p>The webinar is like a teleconference and an interactive video tutorial in one.</p>
<p>Because we ask clients about their requirements upfront, we can really focus on their needs during the demo. This way we don’t waste time by showing everything in Active Collab if they’re interested just in time tracking.</p>

<div id="teamviewer" class="section level2">
<h2>TeamViewer</h2>
<p><strong>Screensharing</strong></p>
<p><br />
For screen sharing and solving technical problems, we use TeamViewer.</p>
<p>From our experience, TeamViewer outperforms chat, email, or Skype for anything that requires a solution on the spot.</p>
<p>If you ever tried explaining a technical problem over the phone, you know it’s hard to find the right words. People have trouble using technical jargon or describing their screen, which makes it confusing for both sides. TeamViewer removes this barrier by letting you see the person’s screen over the internet and take control of their mouse/keyboard.</p>
<p>A client grants us access to their computer, observes what we’re doing, and works alongside. It’s like being next to them, using the same computer.</p>
<p>For example, we use TeamViewer to help someone install Active Collab on their server. We can see what their database looks like, what options are enabled, and what parameters we need to change.</p>
<p>The client can see everything we do on their computer and take control whenever they want (for example, to enter a username or password).</p>
<p><br />
<br />
<img src="media/file21.png" alt="Remote support saves time" /></p>
<blockquote>

<div id="skitch" class="section level2">
<h2>Skitch</h2>
<p><strong>Screenshot annotation</strong></p>
<p><br />
For taking and annotating screenshots, we use Skitch.</p>
<p>It lets us draw on screenshots, add helpful notes, cross out what to remove, and blur certain parts to hide sensitive information.</p>
<p>Skitch is great for showing clients where to click: we take a screenshot, draw an arrow, and share a link in less than a minute.</p>
<p>We also use it to show developers what to change in the app. For example, when we design a new feature, we suggest improvements and send the annotated screenshot to the developer.</p>
<p>Skitch is best used for creating disposable screenshots - they’re fast to make and easy to share. For creating professional looking screenshots (for our website or blog), we create the interface from scratch in a vector graphics app called Sketch.</p>
<p><br />
<br />

<div id="atext" class="section level2">
<h2>aText</h2>
<p><strong>Typing shortcuts</strong></p>
<p><br />
aText lets us respond to chats and emails faster.</p>
<p>It’s a typing shortcut app we have installed on our Macs. We associate frequent phrases with a trigger keyword/abbreviation. When we type an abbreviation in any text field, it’s automatically expanded to a full phrase.</p>
<p>For example, when someone asks us something on LiveChat but we need time to find the answer, we just write “mnt” and it expands to “Please give me a minute or two to find the answer, I’ll be right back”.</p>
<p>To make the most of the app, you first have to think about which phrases you use the most. After a while, each of our agents created their own database of canned responses. This now saves a lot of time (faster typing) and mental effort (deciding how to phrase thoughts). It also eliminates typos and grammatical errors.</p>
<p>aText has other neat features like inserting current date or a day in the future or past (eg. next Sunday), capitalizing new sentences, etc.</p>
<p><br />
<br />

<h2>AutoTextExpander</h2>
<p><strong>Typing shortcuts</strong></p>
<p><br />
Auto Text Expander lets us type faster in a browser.</p>
<p>It’s a typing shortcut tool like aText, only it’s a free browser extension. It’s simple to use and saves us from typing the same phrases over and over, in case the computer doesn’t have an aText license.</p>
<p>This is a great extension when you need to type your email address often. You define the abbreviation (like <span class="citation">@aa</span>) and it expands to your whole email.</p>
<p>Or when you’re answering emails, you can preset canned greetings and use it in all the messages.</p>
<p>We can even use it in Active Collab to provide feedback, or generate a template for a bug report we then fill out.</p>

<h2>Gorgias</h2>
<p><strong>Email templating</strong></p>
<p><br />
For sending bulk emails where each has to be slightly customized, we use Gorgias.</p>
<p>It’s an extension that prepopulates email subject and body. Auto Text Expander does a similar thing, but Gorgias is specifically designed for Gmail.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of how we use it: when customers report a bug or requests a feature, we make a task in Active Collab and save their address. When it’s fixed, we collect all the emails and notify the people via Gmail.</p>
<p>With Gorgias, we create a new email, choose the Bug template, and manually update the message with the bug that was fixed. We then Bcc. all the recipient emails, so clients don’t see each other’s emails and all the replies go to our address.</p>
<p>Note: this is a manual, quick-and-easy solution when you have to send just a few emails. In case you need to send hundreds of emails, set up a transactional email service like Mailgun. It requires coding and time, but gives you more power.</p>

Recordit is good for quickly creating gif screenshots for social media.</p>
<p>Gif screenshots in blog posts and tweets let users watch new features in action and see the benefit instantly.</p>
<p>They’re perfect because they don’t require any input from users (like pressing play or pause) since they go around in loops. This makes them great attention-grabbers.</p>
<p>Although the quality of the gif isn’t that great, posts on social media have a short lifespan so investing more time in creation isn’t worth it. That’s why Recordit is so good - it’s just fast.</p>

<h2>Wistia</h2>
<p><strong>Video hosting</strong></p>
<p><br />
We host our tutorial and explainer videos on Wistia.</p>
<p>After we upload a video, Wistia gives a code which we embed in our Help section. We can customize how we want the video to look and add/remove controls.</p>
<p>What makes Wistia amazing is the graph that shows how people watched our videos, where they paused, and which parts they skipped.</p>
<p>We later use this info to make better, more engaging videos by cutting out parts that got skipped. Thanks to Wistia, our users now watch 80% of our videos (compared to 68% before we introduced the improvements).</p>
<p>We also replaced a bunch of static screenshots with videos, which are a lot more useful and concise. We record a process that would require a lot of explaining (like how to organize tasks in Active Collab) and then replace the static screenshots.</p>
<p>So instead of having to write things like “click the Column View icon in the upper right corner of the right sidebar” or adding tacky Skitch arrows to screenshots, we just have one self-explanatory video.</p>

<p><strong>Commenting</strong></p>
<p><br />
We use Disqus as a commenting system on our help pages and blog.</p>
<p>Setup is very easy - we just created an account, put a piece of code on our site, and the commenting system was up and running.</p>
<p>In order to leave comments, a visitor needs to have a Disqus profile. Which isn’t a problem, because a lot of other websites use Disqus. With an account, a person has all their comments in one place and gets notifications when there’s a reply.</p>
<p>Because we have a static blog, we chose Disqus for commenting. This saved us from coding the commenting section, voting, moderation dashboard, and worrying about security (as we don’t connect to a database).</p>
<p>We also have commenting as part of our help section. Each help article has a public discussion. Users can ask questions, leave comments, and help each other — thanks to Disqus, commenting is possible anywhere on our website.</p>

<p><strong>User-generated help</strong><br />
Users can share their installation experience and help others who have similar problems. It’s like a public support channel where everyone can participate and help.</p>
